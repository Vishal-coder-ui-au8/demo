1) What is the similarity between "ping" & "traceroute"? - 2 Marks

   Ping and traceroute both are primarily used to test the network connectivity issues. 
   Ping does the same with a direct approach to the host while traceroute approaches the host gathering information at each node it 
   passes through.

2)  What is OWASP? And explain the top to Owasp?- 10 Marks

    OWASP:- The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a non-profit foundation dedicated to improving the security of software
    
    Top 10 OWASP:-

    i) Injection:- Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as a command or query. 
                   The attackerâ€™s hostile data can trick the interpreter for accessing data without proper authorization.

    ii) Broken AUthentication:- Functions related to authentication implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to steal the passwords, 
                                session tokens and accessing other user's identities.

    iii) Sensitive Data information:- Many web applications and apis do not protect sensitive data like financial, complicated docs.
                                      Attackers may steal the data and credit card information.

    iv) XML External Entities:- older xml processors evaluate external entity references within xml documnets which can be diclose to DDos 
                                attack,...

    v) Broken Access Control:- Due to improper enforcement restrictions on authentication attckers can access unauthorized data from user'
                               accounts, sensitive data,...

    vi) Security Misconfiguration:- insecure default configurations, incomplete configurations, misconfigured HTTP headers. All these should 
                                    be securely cofigured.

    vii) Cross-Site Scripting(XSS):- occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web pagewithout proper validation.
                                     XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim's browser which can get hacked user sessions

    viii) Insecure Deserialization:- Leads to remote code execution results in injection attacks, escalation attacks.

    ix) Using Components with known vulnerabilities:- libraries, frameworks and software modules run with the same privileges a sthe apllication.
                                                      If these components are exploited, it will results to seroius data loss.

    x) Insufficient Logging and monitoring:- due to this monitoring attackers will attack sysytems, destroy data nad extract data

3)  What is the difference between a process and a thread? - 2 Marks

                         Process                                                       Thread
    --> A program in execution (or) an active program is            --> A thread is a subset or part of the process.   
        known as Process.                                               execution of running multiple tasks or programs at the 
                                                                        same time.

    --> If one server process is blocked no other server process    --> Second thread in the same task could run, while one server 
        can execute until the first process unblocked.                  thread is blocked.
                                                                    
    --> Process is isolated does not share memory with any other    --> Threads share memory.
        process.                                                                

    --> Process takes more time to terminate.	                    --> Thread takes less time to terminate.    

4) What is the difference between exec and fork? - 2 Marks    

   fork:-  fork is a system call which creates the duplicate of the calling process and the new process is known as child process.
           In other words, if a process is running and one wants to create a exact copy of that particular process then fork() is used.
           Here, the process running id will vary.
   
   exec:-  In exec id will be same for current and new process. exec system call always replaces the executed program with a new process.
           In other words, it replaces an existing process with a new program specified in the parameter of the exec().
           Working:-  i) Create two files a.file and b.file
                      ii) a.file is replacing process
                      iii) b.file will call execv()
                      iv) a.file will go to replace b.file having same running id.

5) What is "nohup" used for? - 2 Marks

   nohup stahns for no hangup. it is a command that ignores HUP signal. It is a signal that is delivered to a process when the terminal
   is terminated. If we want to continue running process even after logout from the terminal, we use nohup command. It makes the
   process present to HUP signals to make the program run even after logout.

6) What is swap and what is it used for? - 2 Marks

   Swap space is a virtual memory that is on hard disk, used when RAM is full and later when the RAM is free swap is no longer used 
   In other words, it is the place where memory can be stored when RAM is no longer taking memory.

7) What Unix/Linux commands will alter a files ownership, files permissions? - 2 Marks

   --> Unix/Linux divides the file permissions into read, write and execute.
   --> The permission on a file can be changed by "chmod" command.
   --> "chown" command can change the ownership on a file.
            i) chmod +rwx filename to add permissions.
            ii) chmod -rwx directoryname to remove permissions.
            iii) chmod +x filename to allow executable permissions.
            iv) chmod -wx filename to take out write and executable permissions.

8) What is Transaction? Explain how transaction happens in mongodb and postgresql? - 10 Marks

   Transaction:- It is a function, if the promise returned from the callback is resolved successfully then the transaction is committed
                 If the promise is rejected then the transaction is rolled backup

   postgresql:- in postgresql a transaction is set up by the SQL commands of the transaction with BEGIN and COMMIT commands.
                If you do not issue a BEGIN command, then each individual statement has an implicit BEGIN and (if successful) COMMIT 
                wrapped around it.     
                It is the propagation of one or more changes to the database. For example, if you are creating a record, updating a record, 
                or deleting a record from the table, then you are performing transaction on the table          

   mongodb:- mongodb supports single and multiple document transactions:- 
             i) in single document transaction it will save one document so database schema should be designed to save all the data needed 
                in one document      
             ii) in multi-document transaction When a transaction commits, all data changes made in the transaction are saved and visible outside 
                 the transaction.Until a transaction commits, the data changes made in the transaction are not visible outside the transaction 
                 When a transaction aborts, all data changes made in the transaction are discarded without ever becoming visible. 
                 For example, if any operation in the transaction fails, the transaction aborts and all data changes made in the transaction 
                 are discarded without ever becoming visible        

9) What is the CAP theorem? Give examples of each? - 5 Marks

   CAP Theorem:- CAP stands for Consistency, Availability and partition tolerance. The CAP theorem states that a distributed system cannot 
                 simultaneously be consistent, available, and partition tolerant

                 E.x:- in a distributed system, if a partition occurs between two nodes, it is impossible to provide consistent data on both
                       the nodes and availability of complete data

10) Differentiate between multithreading and asynchronous? - 2 Marks

    multithreading:- Multi threading means that your program runs parallel on multiple threads

    asynchronous:- asynchronous refers to something not occuring at the same time as another thing.

11) Differentiate between SQL and No-SQL? - 5 Marks

    SQL (Structured Query Language):- i) SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema which cannot be changed.
                                      
                                      ii) SQL databases are table based.
                                      
                                      iii) SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Database Management System(RDBMS)
                                      
                                      iv) Vertically scalable
                                      
                                      v) SQL programming can be effectively used to insert, search, update, delete database records.
                                      
                                      vi) MySQL Database, Oracle, Ms SQL Server, Sybase, etc. use SQL.

    NOSQL (Not only Sql):- i) NOSQL databases have dynamic schemas(schema changes as you add data) for unstructured data.
                           
                           ii) NOSQL databases are document, key-value, graph stores.
                           
                           iii) NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database
                           
                           iv) Horizontally scalable
                           
                           v) NoSQL is used for Big data and real-time web apps.
                           
                           vi) Twitter, Facebook, Google use NOSQL to collect terabytes of user data every single day where the user data 
                               will be unstructured data.

12) How do you stop a DDoS attack? - 2 Marks

    It will prevent website from functioning correctly by sending multiple requests by exceeding the website's capacity to handle multiple requests.
     
    Steps to prevent:- i) identify the DDos attack at early stage because the earlier stage toubleshooting the problems sooner you can stop it.

                       ii) Organization should react quickly and create a playbook that documents in detail when attack is detected

                       iii) should call a DDos specialist to reduce the severity of attack.

                       iv) should call host provider if you are not the host                                                             

                       v) Secure network infrastructure

13) What is the difference between hardlinks and symlinks? What happens when you remove the source to a symlink/hardlink? - 4 Marks                       
 
    hardlinks:- i) it is a link that connects many files with the same datastructure called inode.

                ii) if the original file is deleted, the hard link still exists as long as there is a file linked to the datastructure

                iii) it can be used as a backup plan in the system if we lose a file we still have others consisting same file in inode.

                iv) hard link cannot link to files not to directories 

    symlinks:- i) Link that acts as a shortcut of a file. Each symlink file contains a different inode which links to original file 

               ii) if symlink is deleted, the original still exists. but if original file gets deleted sym file will not work due to it links 
                   to the nonexistent file.

               iii) symlink can link to file or directory
